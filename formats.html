    <h1>Magic: The Gathering Formats</h1>

    <!-- Explanation on what formats are in magic -->
    <div>
        <h2>What are Formats in Magic: The Gathering?</h2>

        <p>In Magic: The Gathering, a format defines:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>How big your deck must be</li>
            <li>Which cards you're allowed to use</li>
            <li>How many players take part</li>
            <li>Whether the game is competetive</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Some formats are great for learning, others for cellecting, and some for organised tournament play.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Breakdown of the different formats -->
    <div>
        <h2> Constructed Formats</h2>
        
        <p><em>You build your deck before the game using your own cards.</em></p>

        <h3>Standard</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for</strong>: New players, learning the basics, local game nights.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Deck Size:</strong> Minimum 60 cards</li>
            <li><strong>Copies allowed:</strong> Up to 4 of each card (except basic lands)</li>
            <li><strong>Card pool:</strong>Only the most recent sets (rotates every year)</li>
            <li><strong>Players:</strong> Usually 2</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Standard keeps the game fresh by regularly changing which sets are legal. Because the card pool is smaller, it's easier for beginners to understand and less overwhelming.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Modern</h3>

        <p>Best for: Players who want deeper strategies without going fully old-school</p> 

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Card pool:</strong> Most cards from 2003 onwards</li>  
        <li><strong>Copies allowed:</strong> Up to 4 of each card (except basic lands)</li>
        <li><strong>Deck Size:</strong> Minimum 60 cards</li>
        <li><strong>Players:</strong> Usually 2</li> 
        </ul>

        <p>Modern is faster and more powerful than Standard. Games can end quickly, and decks often focus on very specific strategies.</p>
