        <h1>Magic: The Gathering Formats</h1>

        <!-- Explanation on what formats are in magic -->
        <div>
            <h2>What are Formats in Magic: The Gathering?</h2>

            <p>In Magic: The Gathering, a format is the type of game mode you will be playing and it defines:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>How big your deck must be</li>
                <li>Which cards you're allowed to use</li>
                <li>How many players take part</li>
                <li>Whether the game is competetive</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some formats are great for learning, others for collecting, and some for organised tournament play.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Breakdown of the different formats -->
        <div>
            <h2 id="constructed"> Constructed Formats</h2>
            
            <p><em>You build your deck before the game using your own cards.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 id="standard">Standard</h3>

            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> New players, learning the basics, local game nights.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deck Size:</strong> Minimum 60 cards</li>
                <li><strong>Copies allowed:</strong> Up to 4 of each card (except basic lands)</li>
                <li><strong>Card pool:</strong> Only the most recent sets (rotates every year)</li>
                <li><strong>Players:</strong> Usually 2</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Standard keeps the game fresh by regularly changing which sets are legal. Because the card pool is smaller, it's easier for beginners to understand and less overwhelming.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 id="modern">Modern</h3>

            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Players who want deeper strategies without going fully old-school</p> 

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deck Size:</strong> Minimum 60 cards</li>
                <li><strong>Copies allowed:</strong> Up to 4 of each card (except basic lands)</li>
                <li><strong>Card pool:</strong> Most cards from 2003 onwards</li>
                <li><strong>Players:</strong> Usually 2</li> 
            </ul>

            <p>Modern is faster and more powerful than Standard. Games can end quickly, and decks often focus on very specific strategies.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 id="legacy">Legacy & Vintage</h3>

            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Long-time players and collectors</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deck Size:</strong> Minimum 60 cards</li>
                <li><strong>Copies allowed:</strong> Up to 4 of each card (except basic lands)</li>
                <li><strong>Card pool:</strong> Almost all Magic cards ever printed</li>  
            </ul>

            <p>These formats use extremely powerful cards and can be very expensive. Vintage allows nearly everything but restricts some cards to single copy instead of banning them outright.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 id="commander">Commander (EDH)</h3>

            <p><strong>Best for:</strong>Casual play, multiplayer games, social Magic</p>

            <p>This is one of the most popular formats in the world.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deck Size:</strong> Exactly 100 cards</li>
                <li><strong>Copies allowed:</strong> Only 1 copy of each card (except basic lands)</li>
                <li><strong>Commander:</strong> A legandary creature that leads your deck</li>  
                <li><strong>Card colours:</strong> Every card must match your commander's colour identity</li>
                <li><strong>Starting life:</strong> 40 life per player</li>
                <li><strong>Players:</strong> Usually 3 - 5</li>  
            </ul>

            <p>Commander games are slower, splashier, and more social. Politics, alliances, and big dramatic plays are common. It's ideal for relaxed play and storytelling.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 id="limited">Limited Formats</h2>

            <p><em>You build your deck during the event using opened booster packs.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 id="draft">Draft</h3>

            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Learning card evaluation and deck-building skills</p> 

            <ul>
                <li>Players sit in a group and open booster packs one at a time</li>
                <li>Cards chosen one by one and passed around the table</li>
                <li>Decks must have at least 40 cards</li>
                <li>Basic lands are provided</li> 
            </ul>

            <p>Draft tests your ability to adapt and read what other players are doing.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 id="sealed">Sealed</h3>

            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> New players, prerelease events</p> 

            <ul>
                <li>Each player opens a set number of booster packs</li>
                <li>Build a deck of at least 40 cards from those cards</li>
                <li>Basic lands are provided</li> 
            </ul>

            <p>Sealed is slower and more forgiving than Draft, making it ideal for beginners and friendly events.</p>
