            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        
            <p><strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> MTG or Magic for short, is a world renowned trading card game which was created by Richard Garfield and first published in 1993. 
            It combines the strategy, creativity and imagination into a fantasy themed game played and enjoyed by millions of people. 
            It has become so popular that they have even created an official online <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering Arena</a> game.
            <br>
            The players take on the role of a planeswalker which is a powerful spellcaster who uses spells, creatures and artifacts to rain supreme over their opponents.
            <br>
            Whether you enjoy fantasy stories, problem-solving, or social games with friends, MTG offers something for everyone.

            <img src="./images/playing mtg.jpg" alt="Playing Magic: The Gathering">

            <p>MTG is typically played with 2 or more players, each player starts with:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A deck of <strong>at least 60 cards</strong> (other game modes allow for larger or small decks)</li>
                <li><strong>20 life points</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Players then take turns:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Drawing cards</li>
                <li>Playing <strong>lands</strong> to generate mana</li>
                <li>Casting spells and summoning creatures</li>
                <li>Attacking opponents to reduce their life total</li>
            </ol>

            <p>A player will rain victorious once they have depleted their opponents life total to 0, or by meeting special win conditions</p>
